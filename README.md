### 2. CONFIG FILE

First, you should set the options in config.ini. Make sure the game option is set to `gold`, `silver` or `crystal`, and that you have set the right game.  
Then, set your starting pokemon's species, level, and IVs under `[poke]`.  
Under `[files]`, you'll want to enter the file names of your desired input file and output file destination.  
The options under `[util]` should generally be set to true, unless you really don't want to know how many X items/rarecandies/stat boosting items you used.  

\[More advanced: to use more than one config file, you can use the command line option `java -jar <RouteTwo filename> <config filename>`.\]

`"alias"` : An alias refers to a shorter name for a given command.
